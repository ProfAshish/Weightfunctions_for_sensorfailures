# Weightfunctions_for_sensorfailures
This repository has three files. 
new_1D_weightfunction.m is for linear arrays (ULAs and sparse linear arrays). You can find the weight function for healthy and faulty arrays.
new_2D_weightfunction.m is for planar arrays (URAs and 2D sparse arrays). 
There is one more program named new_IES_to_sensor_positions_autoconvert.m that can convert from inter-element spacing (IES) notation to the actual sensor positions. 
This will be useful when working with traditional sparse arrays or modern ones like the MISC array, Two-sided Extended nested array (TS-ENA), GENAMS etc.
